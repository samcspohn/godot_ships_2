base:
	targets are ships that have the largest silhouette. broadside targets are larger than bow/stern in
	will increase its engagement distance based on hp ratio

	positioning uses server-cached cluster data:
		- server computes ship clusters per team each frame (ships within 3000m grouped together)
		- avg_enemy and avg_friendly positions are precomputed on server
		- bots use cached data instead of computing averages themselves
Battleship:
	prefers ap.
	AP at:
		broadside cruisers waterline
		angled cruiser bow/stern when angled 30 degrees
		battleship superstructure when angled
		battleship waterline when broadside
	HE at:
		heavily angled battleships 10 degrees
		destroyers

	prefers direct engagements, pushing towards target and keeping medium distance.
	will kite if outnumbered towards friendly side of the map or friendly team mates

Cruiser:
	prefer HE
	AP at:
		broadside battleships upper belt when < 6000
		broadside cruisers upper belt when < 10000
		broadside cruisers lower belt when < 7000
	HE at:
		battleship superstructure when angled
		cruiser upper belt when angled
		destroyers

	prefers to kite

	will attempt to use islands for cover:
		- finds optimal island within gun range of target
		- island choice based on HP:
			- high HP: aggressive positioning at ~50% gun range to target
			- low HP: defensive positioning at ~70% gun range to target
		- approximates island as circle, positions on opposite side from enemies
		- if detected (visible_to_enemy), moves further behind island
		- if in cover and undetected, stays still
		- prefers cover over kiting for first 60 seconds of engagement
		- only checks shell arcs when close to island to verify can shoot over
		- abandonment rules:
			- abandons cover if enemies move beyond 80% gun range (too far to shoot)
			- abandons cover if enemies get within 35% gun range (too close, kite to farther cover)
			- otherwise stays at current island
		- falls back to normal kiting if no suitable island or can't shoot from cover

	will not go for cover when hunting especially against other cruisers and destroyers

Destroyer:
	prefer HE
	AP at:
		broadside cruisers when < 1000
		broadside cruisers waterline < 500
		broadside destroyers at waterline when < 1000
	HE at:
		Battleship, Cruiser superstructure
		Destroyers

	ideal torpedo targets push in at 45 degrees

	torpedo launching:
		- tracks target lead angle changes over time to predict movement
		- adjusts aim ahead or behind based on lead angle change rate
		- fires 5-torpedo spread pattern around predicted interception point
		- spread angle increases with range (~3° base + 0.6° per km)
		- fire interval scales with range (0.5s at close, 15s at 10km)
		- each torpedo in spread is checked for terrain collision
		- skips spread positions that would hit terrain or friendlies

	will avoid shooting unless spotted and will stop shooting when closest ship is outside concealment radius
	will shoot from long range after torpedoes land and target is flooding
	will not shoot when low health (< 30% HP) - prioritizes stealth and survival

	will chase and engage enemy destroyers when having advantage
