# Hit Counter System Implementation Summary

## IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ✓

The hit counter system has been successfully implemented with the following key changes:

### ✅ Camera UI Scene Updates (`/src/camera/camera_ui_scene.gd`)
- **Removed**: Runtime UI creation system (`create_hit_counter` function)
- **Added**: @onready references to all pre-created UI elements
- **Modified**: `show_hit_counter()` to use visibility toggling instead of creation
- **Updated**: `update_hit_counters()` to hide expired counters instead of destroying them
- **Added**: `setup_hit_counter_system()` for initial configuration

### ✅ Scene File Updates (`/scenes/camera_ui.tscn`)
- **Added**: MainCounterTemp container with 5 pre-created hit counter elements
- **Added**: SecCounterTemp container with 5 pre-created hit counter elements
- **Configured**: All counters with proper styling matching existing permanent counters
- **Labeled**: Secondary counters with "(SEC)" designation

### ✅ PlayerController Integration (`/src/client/PlayerController.gd`)
- **Modified**: Removed immediate clearing of damage_events to allow dual processing
- **Result**: Both floating damage and hit counter systems can process events

### ✅ Key Features Implemented
1. **5-second timer system** - Counters appear for exactly 5 seconds
2. **Increment behavior** - Same hit type increments count and resets timer
3. **Main vs Secondary distinction** - Different containers for different weapon types
4. **Visual consistency** - Identical styling to existing permanent counters
5. **Performance optimization** - Visibility toggling instead of create/destroy cycles
6. **Proper cleanup** - Containers hidden when no active counters

### ✅ Testing Infrastructure
- **Created**: Test script for validation (`test_hit_counter_visibility.gd`)
- **Created**: Test scene for manual verification
- **Verified**: No compilation errors in implementation

### ✅ Documentation
- **Updated**: Complete documentation reflecting new visibility-based approach
- **Documented**: All functions, integration points, and usage instructions

## System Architecture

### Pre-created UI Elements
```
MainContainer/TopRightPanel/
├── MainCounterTemp/
│   ├── TempPenetrationCounter
│   ├── TempOverpenetrationCounter  
│   ├── TempShatterCounter
│   ├── TempRicochetCounter
│   └── TempCitadelCounter
└── SecCounterTemp/
    ├── TempPenetrationCounter (with "(SEC)" label)
    ├── TempOverpenetrationCounter (with "(SEC)" label)
    ├── TempShatterCounter (with "(SEC)" label) 
    ├── TempRicochetCounter (with "(SEC)" label)
    └── TempCitadelCounter (with "(SEC)" label)
```

### Event Flow
1. **Damage occurs** → Events added to `ship.stats.damage_events`
2. **PlayerController processes** → Floating damage shown
3. **Camera UI processes** → Hit counters shown via visibility toggle
4. **Timer management** → Counters hidden after 5 seconds
5. **Event cleanup** → Array cleared to prevent duplicates

## Ready for Testing

The system is now complete and ready for gameplay testing. When damage events occur:
- Hit counters will appear in the appropriate containers (MainCounterTemp/SecCounterTemp)
- Counters will display for 5 seconds with proper styling
- Multiple hits of the same type will increment count and reset timer
- Main and secondary weapon hits will be properly distinguished

The implementation uses efficient visibility toggling and maintains perfect visual consistency with the existing UI system.
